Priorities is a Java spring boot application, to list down user priorities and orders in multiple areas.


## Description

**Description:** 

There are 4 areas that a user can allot different priorities to. 

1. Connection
2. Relationships

Company admin/creator should have the ability to add more areas in the backend later if needed.
